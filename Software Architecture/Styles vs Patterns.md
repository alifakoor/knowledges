**Architectural Styles** are high-level strategies that provide an abstract framework for a family of systems. An architectural style improves partitioning and promotes design reuse by frequently solving recurring problems. You can think of it as the theme or aesthetic that guides the design of buildings or homes. Examples include Layered, Event-Driven, and Microservices.

**Architectural Patterns** are more concrete and are specific to a particular problem or module within the system. They provide a structured solution to architectural issues, detailing how components and interactions should be structured for specific functionality. They are similar to software design patterns but work at a higher level of abstraction. Examples include Model-View-Controller (MVC), Publish-Subscribe, and Serverless.
