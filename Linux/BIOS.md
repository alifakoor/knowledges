BIOS, or Basic Input/Output System, is a [[firmware interface]] that initializes and tests hardware components during the booting process of a computer. Here are some key points about BIOS:

1. **Initialization and Testing**: When a computer is powered on, the BIOS is the first software that runs. It performs a Power-On Self Test (POST) to check the system hardware and ensure everything is functioning correctly.

2. **Firmware Interface**: BIOS is stored on a small memory chip on the motherboard. It provides a set of low-level routines that the operating system can use to interface with different hardware components like the keyboard, display, and storage devices.

3. **Boot Process**: After initializing and testing the hardware, BIOS locates the operating system's boot loader from a predefined boot device (e.g., hard drive, SSD, USB drive). It then transfers control to this boot loader to start the operating system.

4. **Configuration Settings**: BIOS includes a setup utility that allows users to configure hardware settings. This utility can be accessed by pressing a specific key (like F2, F10, DEL, etc.) during the POST phase. Users can configure system settings such as boot sequence, clock speeds, power management, and security options.

5. **Legacy and [[UEFI]]**: Traditional BIOS has been largely replaced by UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) in modern computers. UEFI offers more advanced features, including support for larger hard drives, faster boot times, and enhanced security. However, it often retains a BIOS compatibility mode for backward compatibility with older software.

BIOS is a critical component for the proper functioning of a computer, ensuring that the hardware is ready and capable of supporting the operating system and applications.
