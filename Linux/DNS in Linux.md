The configuration file `/etc/systemd/resolved.conf` is part of the `systemd-resolved` service, which handles network name resolution in Linux. This service provides DNS, LLMNR, and mDNS resolution for applications. The configurations in the `[Resolve]` section are settings that define how DNS resolution should be handled.

In the specific configurations you provided:

```ini
[Resolve]
DNS={{ dns.dns }}
FallbackDNS={{ dns.fallback_dns }}
DNSSEC={{ dns.dnssec }}
DNSOverTLS={{ dns.dns_over_tls }}
```

These variables are placeholders that are likely populated using a template system, such as Ansible. Let's break down what each of these settings represents in the context of `systemd-resolved`:

### 1. **DNS=** (`{{ dns.dns }}`)
This setting defines the primary DNS server(s) to use for resolving domain names. The variable `{{ dns.dns }}` would be substituted with one or more IP addresses of DNS servers in a template (e.g., `8.8.8.8`, `1.1.1.1`).

Example:
```ini
DNS=8.8.8.8 1.1.1.1
```
This means that `systemd-resolved` will use Google's DNS server (8.8.8.8) and Cloudflare's DNS server (1.1.1.1) for name resolution.

### 2. **FallbackDNS=** (`{{ dns.fallback_dns }}`)
This setting defines the fallback DNS server(s) to use in case the primary DNS servers specified in `DNS=` are unreachable. This ensures that DNS resolution can still work even if the primary servers fail.

Example:
```ini
FallbackDNS=9.9.9.9
```
This would configure Quad9 (9.9.9.9) as a fallback DNS server in case the primary DNS servers are unavailable.

### 3. **DNSSEC=** (`{{ dns.dnssec }}`)
This setting enables or disables DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions), which is a security feature that helps protect against DNS spoofing by validating DNS responses. It ensures that the DNS responses come from the correct and authorized source.

Possible values for this setting:
- `yes`: DNSSEC validation is enabled.
- `no`: DNSSEC validation is disabled.
- `allow-downgrade`: DNSSEC is attempted, but if the DNS server does not support DNSSEC, it will fall back to normal DNS.

Example:
```ini
DNSSEC=yes
```
This enables DNSSEC validation, ensuring secure DNS queries.

### 4. **DNSOverTLS=** (`{{ dns.dns_over_tls }}`)
This setting enables or disables DNS-over-TLS (DoT), a protocol that encrypts DNS queries to protect privacy. By using DoT, DNS queries are sent over an encrypted connection to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.

Possible values for this setting:
- `yes`: DNS-over-TLS is enabled.
- `no`: DNS-over-TLS is disabled.
- `opportunistic`: DoT is used if the DNS server supports it, but falls back to plain DNS if not.

Example:
```ini
DNSOverTLS=yes
```
This would enable DNS-over-TLS, ensuring that DNS queries are encrypted when supported by the DNS server.

### Summary of Example:
In practice, this file with actual DNS values might look like this after being templated:

```ini
[Resolve]
DNS=8.8.8.8 1.1.1.1
FallbackDNS=9.9.9.9
DNSSEC=yes
DNSOverTLS=yes
```

This configuration would instruct `systemd-resolved` to use Google's (8.8.8.8) and Cloudflare's (1.1.1.1) DNS servers, fall back to Quad9 (9.9.9.9) if those fail, enforce DNSSEC for secure name resolution, and encrypt DNS queries using DNS-over-TLS.

### Key Use Cases:
- **DNS**: Define the DNS servers for domain name resolution.
- **FallbackDNS**: Provide a backup in case primary DNS servers fail.
- **DNSSEC**: Add security to DNS lookups by verifying responses.
- **DNSOverTLS**: Enhance privacy by encrypting DNS queries.

This is useful in system hardening, security enhancements, or ensuring that the network configuration is more resilient and private.
