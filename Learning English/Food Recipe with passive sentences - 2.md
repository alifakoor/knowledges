To start, we must clean the squid and remove its tentacles. Then, we can make the filling mixture by combining minced shrimp, finely chopped mussels, and cooked salmon flakes. We should mix these ingredients with a little bit of lemon juice, red pepper flakes, and finely chopped garlic. The filling mixture should then be spooned into the squid and closed using toothpicks.

Next, we can prepare the avocado and mango salsa. We should peel and dice the avocado, and peel and chop the mango into small pieces. We should mix these ingredients together with finely chopped cucumber and red onion, and season it with a little bit of salt and pepper. The salsa should then be refrigerated for at least 30 minutes before serving.

Now, it's time to cook the stuffed squid. We should sear the squid in a hot pan until it's golden brown on both sides. Then, we can transfer it to a baking dish and bake it in the oven for 10-15 minutes until it's fully cooked.

To make the dish even more delicious, we can add some extra flavors and textures. We can use a variety of seafood such as crab, lobster, or even tuna, to give the filling mixture a richer flavor and a variety of textures. Adding some finely chopped fresh herbs like basil, parsley, or cilantro can also give it a fresh and aromatic touch.

For the side dish, instead of just saut√©ing the green beans and beets, we can add some roasted red pepper and eggplant to the mix, which will give it a smoky flavor and a more vibrant color. We can also top it off with some chopped walnuts or almonds for some added crunchiness.

Finally, the stuffed squid should be served on a bed of the green beans, beets, and roasted veggies, with the avocado and mango salsa spooned over the top. A few fresh cherries can be added as a garnish to complete this delicious and impressive dish.

I hope you enjoy making and eating this recipe as much as I do. Let me know how it turns out for you!
