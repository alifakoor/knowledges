Hi again after two weeks
I'm going to talk about my last week
be honest I had tough week
I was sick all day early in the week
I don't know what it was, but doctor said to me you just need rest and take vitamins
after three or four days, I felt better and I backed to work
at work we had a session to present our works after three weeks, so it was very important for us
fortunately we handled it very well
