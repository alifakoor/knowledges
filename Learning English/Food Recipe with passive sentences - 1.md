It's a truth that as an Iranian guy I love my coubtry dishes, but I think the Ghormeh Sabzi has a global character.  
  
First, the ingredients must be gathered. One pound of beef or lamb should be cut into small pieces and marinated in a mixture of salt, pepper, and turmeric. Then, a large handful of fresh parsley, and green onions must be washed and finely chopped.  
  
Next, a large pot should be heated on medium-high heat and the meat should be browned on all sides. Once the meat is browned, it should be set aside on a plate.  
  
In the same pot, a generous amount of vegetable oil should be added along with chopped onions, which must be sautéed until they are soft and translucent. Then, the garlic, which must be chopped finely, should be added and sautéed until fragrant.  
  
After that, the chopped herbs should be added to the pot. The mixture should be stirred well and left to cook for a few minutes.  
  
Then, the meat should be added back into the pot along with a can of red beans and enough water to cover the mixture. The pot should be covered and left to simmer on low heat for a few hours until the meat is tender and the flavors have melded together.  
  
Before serving, the dish should be garnished with some freshly lime, which adds a tangy and refreshing flavor to the dish. This dish is best served with a side of rice.  
  
Overall, Ghormeh Sabzi is a delicious and aromatic Iranian dish that is beloved by many. By following these simple steps and using fresh ingredients, anyone can create this flavorful dish in their own kitchen.
