What would you have said to the waiter if he had given you the wrong food?

Having a meal on a restaurant is a pleasant experience because some places have awesome food
great experience in Narenj restaurant => present perfect
except my mom cook
never have bad experience => present perfect
and if the waiter had given me the wrong food, I would have told that please changed it.
but, have bad experience in delivery food => present perfect
order and pay , restaurant cancel order => past prefect and simple past
call the supporter => simple past
have stress => past continuous
they said restaurant not have your food => reported speech
another time
want to try new food and restaurant => simple past
order and pay => simple past
everything was ok
receive food, find out there is something miss => past perfect and simple past
the delivery guy leave it => past perfect
call the supporter => simple past
they said there is no problem => reported speech
can not do anything => simple past
just write some bad comment

in conclusion, order or eat in reliable restaurant
