There are many software architecture factors that are important for choosing a database. Some of the most important factors include:

- **Data model:** The data model is the way that data is organized in the database. Different database types support different data models. For example, relational databases support a relational data model, while NoSQL databases support a variety of non-relational data models.
- **Data access patterns:** The data access patterns are the ways that applications will access data from the database. Different database types are better suited for different data access patterns. For example, relational databases are good for OLTP (online transaction processing) applications, while NoSQL databases are good for OLAP (online analytical processing) applications.
- **Performance:** The performance of the database is important for applications that need to access data quickly. Different database types have different performance characteristics. For example, relational databases are typically faster than NoSQL databases for OLTP applications.
- **Scalability:** The scalability of the database is important for applications that need to handle a large volume of data. Different database types have different scalability characteristics. For example, relational databases can be scaled horizontally by adding more servers, while NoSQL databases can be scaled vertically by adding more memory or storage.
- **Security:** The security of the database is important for applications that handle sensitive data. Different database types have different security features. For example, relational databases typically have more security features than NoSQL databases.
- **Cost:** The cost of the database is important for businesses that need to budget for database software and hardware. Different database types have different costs. For example, open-source relational databases are typically free, while commercial relational databases can be expensive.
- **Ease of use:** The database should be easy to use for both developers and end users.
- **Documentation:** The database should have good documentation that is easy to understand.
- **Support:** The database should have good support from the vendor, including online documentation, forums, and email support.
