what exactly is Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)?
first and foremost, SREs are engineers. We apply the principles of computer science and engineering to the design and development of computing systems: generally, large distributed ones.

Sometimes, our task is writing the software for those systems alongside our product development counterparts; sometimes, our task is building all the additional pieces those systems need, like backups or load balancing, ideally so they can be reused across systems; and sometimes, our task is figuring out how to apply existing solutions to new problems.

Next, we focus on system reliability.
Reliability is the most fundamental feature of any product: a system isnâ€™t very useful if nobody can use it! Because reliability2 is so critical, SREs are focused on finding ways to improve the design and operation of systems to make them more scalable, more reliable, and more efficient.

Finally, SREs are focused on operating services built atop our distributed computing systems, whether those services are planet-scale storage, email for hundreds of millions of users.
