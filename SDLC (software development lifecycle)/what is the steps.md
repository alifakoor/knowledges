The typical stages of the software development lifecycle include:

1.  Requirements gathering: This stage involves understanding and documenting the needs and expectations of the software application or system by gathering requirements from stakeholders, such as users, customers, and business analysts.
    
2.  Design: In this stage, the software development team creates a detailed plan for how the software application or system will be built. This includes defining the architecture, data models, user interfaces, and other design elements.
    
3.  Development: This stage involves writing the code for the software application or system based on the design specifications. It includes activities such as coding, debugging, and unit testing.
    
4.  Testing: Once the software is developed, it goes through various testing activities to identify and fix any defects or issues. This includes functional testing, performance testing, security testing, and other types of testing to ensure that the software meets the requirements and works as expected.
    
5.  Deployment: After the software has been tested and approved, it is deployed to production environments, making it available for users to access and use.
    
6.  Maintenance: Once the software is deployed, it requires ongoing maintenance, including bug fixes, updates, and enhancements, to ensure its continued performance and reliability.
